This project uses:

*Python version 3.5*    
*Tensorflow version 1.1.0*  
 


`mnist_precip.py` file contains the code for a simple multi layered preciptron    
`mnist_rnn.py` file contains the code for a Recurrent Deep Neural Network  
`mnist_.py` file contains the code for a Convolutional Deep Neural Network 


Execute each of the python scripts to see the Model in action and compare Accuracy at the end.
